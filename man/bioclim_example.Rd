\title{Example Bioclimatic Data for Ecological Modeling}
\format{
A data frame with 100 rows and 51 variables:
\describe{
\item{species_richness}{Integer. Number of species observed (response variable)}
\item{bio1_temp through bio15_temp}{Numeric. Temperature-related variables (highly correlated, r ≈ 0.85)}
\item{bio16_precip through bio30_precip}{Numeric. Precipitation-related variables (moderately correlated, r ≈ 0.70)}
\item{bio31_season through bio45_season}{Numeric. Seasonality variables (weakly correlated, r ≈ 0.50)}
\item{bio46_elev through bio50_elev}{Numeric. Elevation variables (independent, r ≈ 0)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data based on typical WorldClim variable structures
}
\usage{
bioclim_example
}
\description{
A simulated dataset representing 50 WorldClim-like bioclimatic variables
measured at 100 geographic locations, with species richness as the response variable.
Variables are organized into correlated blocks representing temperature,
precipitation, seasonality, and elevation.
}
\details{
This dataset demonstrates a common problem in ecological modeling: many bioclimatic
predictors are highly correlated within groups (e.g., different temperature metrics),
leading to multicollinearity issues. The species richness response depends on a subset
of predictors from each group.

\strong{Use case}: Demonstrating \code{corrPrune()} for reducing correlated environmental
predictors before fitting species distribution models.

# Remove highly correlated bioclimatic variables
pruned <- corrPrune(bioclim_example[, -1], threshold = 0.7)
ncol(pruned)  # Reduced from 50 to ~15 variables
